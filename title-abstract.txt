Title:
MedDash - Decoding Health Metrics to Enhance Patient Care

Abstract:
Our project aims to address a critical yet often neglected aspect of healthcare: the effective utilization of daily health data in patients. Despite the richness of information contained in everyday health metrics, these data often go underutilized, leaving significant insights into patient health patterns untapped. Although there are many patient dashboards, this specific dashboard is highly personalized and helps them look into specific or overall metrics. Our objective is to bridge this gap through the development of an innovative daily tracking dashboard, especially for patients whose diseases are undiagnosed and rare. This dashboard is designed to enable users to effectively visualize, comprehend, and monitor vast quantities of daily health data. This dashboard not only aids patients in recognizing normal and irregular health patterns but also provides clinicians with a comprehensive view of patientsâ€™ daily health statuses, complementing traditional medical tests. The significance of this project lies in its potential to transform everyday health data into a valuable asset for both patients and healthcare providers. By highlighting patterns and anomalies in daily health metrics, the dashboard can enhance patient self-awareness and inform clinical decision-making. This approach marks a paradigm shift in patient-centered care, where everyday health data becomes a significant component in diagnosis and treatment strategies.
